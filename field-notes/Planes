Planes

I hate the word “blog.” While this is technically a blog (thanks Squarespace), it’s really not and I have no intention of being a blogger or running a blog. You will never hear me say, “Dude, check out my blog”. If you do, punch me in the mouth as hard as you can and say, “You’re welcome.” I’ll then say, “Thank you,” if I can still talk with my well-deserved fat lip.

I think I may use this space for things I just happen to shoot on a particular day, or for a longer series or project that doesn’t warrant a full category. Or, this just might be it—one and done. I don’t know. Especially since I plan to get off this Squarespace site soon and move to a custom-made website. Stay tuned… or don’t. Not many people venture to photography websites anymore, and I don’t blame anyone. TikTok is way more fun.

Anyway, I was out in the Mojave recently with a fellow photographer, and we happened upon these planes. We almost drove right by them, but I said, “Hey, let’s check out those planes.” So, we did. Here are the photos. That’s all you need to know (because this is not a blog).
